"""Example code for using the json_format API to read JSON data to FhirProtos.

To run via bazel:
```
bazel build //py/google/fhir_examples:json_format_example
bazel-bin/py/google/fhir_examples/json_format_example $WORKSPACE
```

To run using python+pip:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install google-fhir

python3 json_format_example.py $WORKSPACE
```

Where $WORKSPACE is the location of a synthea dataset. For instructions on
setting up your workspace, see the top-level README.md.
